Wensleydale 	Good morning, sir.
Mousebender 	Good Morning. I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through 'Rogue Herries' by Horace Walpole, when suddenly I came over all peckish.
Wensleydale 	Peckish, sir?
Mousebender 	Esurient.
Wensleydale 	Eh?
Mousebender 	(broad Yorkshire) Eee I were all hungry, like!
Wensleydale 	Oh, hungry.
Mousebender 	(normal accent) In a nutshell. So I thought to myself, 'a little fermented curd will do the trick'. So I curtailed my Walpolling activites, sallied forth and infiltrated your place of purveyance to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles. (smacks his lips)
Wensleydale 	Come again.
Mousebender 	(broad nothern accent) I want to buy some cheese.
Wensleydale 	Oh, I thought you were complaining about the music!
Mousebender 	(normal voice) Heaven forbid. I am one who delights in all manifestations of the terpsichorean muse.
Wensleydale 	Sorry?
Mousebender 	I like a nice dance - you're forced to.
 	Quick cut to a Viking.
Viking 	(broad Northern accent) Anyway.
 	Cut back to cheese shop.
Wensleydale 	Who said that?
Mousebender 	(normal voice) Now my good man, some cheese, please.
Wensleydale 	Yes certainly, sir. What would you like?
Mousebender 	Well, how about a little Red Leicester.
Wensleydale 	I'm, afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester, sir.
Mousebender 	Oh, never mind. How are you on Tilsit?
Wensleydale 	Never at the end of the week, sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday.
Mousebender 	Tish tish. No matter. Well, four ounces of Caerphilly, then, if you please, stout yeoman.
Wensleydale 	Ah well, it's been on order for two weeks, sir, I was expecting it this morning.
Mousebender 	Yes, it's not my day, is it? Er, Bel Paese?
Wensleydale 	Sorry.
Mousebender 	Red Windsor?
Wensleydale 	Normally, sir, yes, but today the van broke down.
Mousebender 	Ah. Stilton?
Wensleydale 	Sorry.
Mousebender 	Gruyere? Emmental?
Wensleydale 	No.

Wensleydale 	Ah! We do have some Camembert, sir.
Mousebender 	You do! Excellent.
Wensleydale 	It's a bit runny, sir.
Mousebender 	Oh, I like it runny.
Wensleydale 	Well as a matter of fact it's very runny, sir.
Mousebender 	No matter. No matter. Hand over le fromage de la Belle France qui s'apelle Camembert, s'il vous plaît.
Wensleydale 	I think it's runnier than you like it, sir.
Mousebender 	(smiling grimley) I don't care how excrementally runny it is. Hand it over with all speed.
Wensleydale 	Yes, sir. (bends below counter and reappears) Oh...
Mousebender 	What?
Wensleydale 	The cat's eaten it.
Mousebender 	Has he?
Wensleydale 	She, sir.
Mousebender 	Gouda?
Wensleydale 	No.
Mousebender 	Edam?
Wensleydale 	No.
Mousebender 	Caithness?

Mousebender 	Smoked Austrian?
Wensleydale 	No.
Mousebender 	Sage Darby?
Wensleydale 	No, sir.
Mousebender 	You do have some cheese, do you?
Wensleydale 	Certainly, sir. It's a cheese shop, sir. We've got...
Mousebender 	No, no, no, don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.
Wensleydale 	Fair enough.
Mousebender 	Wensleydale.
Wensleydale 	Yes, sir?
Mousebender 	Splendid. Well, I'll have some of that then, please.
Wensleydale 	Oh, I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reffering to me, Mr Wensleydale.
Mousebender 	Gorgonzola?
Wensleydale 	No.

Wensleydale 	No.
Mousebender 	Venezuelan Beaver Cheese?
Wensleydale 	Not today sir, no.
 	(pause)
Mousebender 	Well let's keep it simple, how about Cheddar?
Wensleydale 	Well, I'm afraid we don't get much call for it around these parts.
Mousebender 	Not call for it? It's the single most popular cheese in the world!
Wensleydale 	Not round these parts, sir.
Mousebender 	And pray what is the most popular cheese round these parts?
Wensleydale 	Ilchester, sir.
Mousebender 	I see.
Wensleydale 	Yes, sir. It's quite staggeringly popular in the manor, squire.
Mousebender 	Is it.
Wensleydale 	Yes sir, it's our number-one seller.
Mousebender 	Is it.
Wensleydale 	Yes sir.
Mousebender 	Ilchester, eh?
Wensleydale 	Right.
Mousebender 	OK, I'm game. Have you got any, he asked, expecting the answer no?
Wensleydale 	I'll have a look, sir...nnnnnnooooooooo.
Mousebender 	It's not much of a cheese shop really, is it?
Wensleydale 	Finest in the district, sir.
Mousebender 	And what leads you to that conclusion?
Wensleydale 	Well, it's so clean.
Mousebender 	Well, it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese.
Wensleydale 	You haven't asked me about Limberger, sir.
Mousebender 	Is it worth it?
Wensleydale 	Could be.
Mousebender 	OK, have you...will you shut that bloody dancing up! (the music stops)
Wensleydale 	(to dancers) Told you so.
Mousebender 	Have you got any Limberger?
Wensleydale 	No.
Mousebender 	No, that figures. It was pretty predictable, really. It was an act of purest optimism to pose the question in the first place. Tell me something, do you have any cheese at all?
Wensleydale 	Yes, sir.
Mousebender 	Now I'm going to ask you that question once more, and if you say 'no' I'm going to shoot you through the head. Now, do you have any cheese at all?
Wensleydale 	No.
Mousebender 	(shoots him) What a senseless waste of human life.
